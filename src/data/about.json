  "helloText": "This page is supposed to be more **_personal_** and **_intimate_** than the other ones, and where I get _nice and close_ to you to tell you what kind of _**b o a r d g a m e s**_ I like to play and other saucy details. Allow me to publicly talk about myself without an 140 character limit.\n\nI think it's kind of obvious that I enjoy coding/working on software (seeing as this site exists), but that's pretty surface level. Please don't perceive me as 'just a coder', I am much worse than that. If it's a nerdy hobby I'm probably invested in it. I play games poorly (board and video), I listen (and forget) to a bunch of podcasts, I follow tech/software news, and I build mechanical keyboards because pretty rectangles. \n\nIn a shitty attempt to diversify my interests, I've been leeching off of my friends; stealing their hobbies a fair bit. Recently (Q4 2021), I've been getting into stationary (pretty stickers and paper), fountain pens (though my writing is still pretty poor), and journaling (though it's like once a month). Another one has been üå±. My track record for _alive_ plants isn't great, but It's getting better with time (I think, they grow pretty slow). I will call it a success when my ivy grows taller than me.\n\nI wish there was a term to say that you're 'into movies/tv' without saying things like 'fanatic', 'buff' or 'enthusiast'. Maybe other people know how to deliver those lines, but I KNOW I would come across douchey if I introduced myself as a 'movie buff'. Plus, if I even vaguely reference [my movie podcast](https://jumpcut.fm), I may as well tattoo \\\"my opinion means shit\\\" on my forehead. \n\nAll of this lead-in was to say that I don't really have 'refined' tastes or an artistic eye. I unironically love the _Fast & Furious movies_ lol. In general though, I'd say my top genres for films are horror/animation/sci-fi. If you got any recs, feel free to hmu.",

      "question": "\"How did you make this site?\"",
      "answer": "Well it's on Github, so you can actually take a look yourself if you want to. It's really just an old Gatsby site and Netlify CMS on the backend. I use Netlify with Github for deployment and that works well enough for me.\n\nThe most attractive parts of the site are really just external libraries implemented in a way I found cute, and a shit ton of CSS on random components. \"Anyone can wear the mask, you can wear the mask.\" - miles morales, spiderverse"

      "question": "\"What makes a good movie in your eyes?\"",
      "answer": "If the world and characters are consistent and well-realized, I will usually enjoy the movie. Of course there needs to be an interesting conflict as well, but I find it extremely rewarding when characters are more gray, than just plain black and white. Motivations and shit I guess.\n\nThat, and a kickass soundtrack or art style. If you are going to be unique, don't half ass it. Media is a form of expression and I'd rather see a punchy, risky choice in your film/show than forgetful generic choices that don't ruffle feathers. Wes Anderson is one of my favs for that reason. Edgar Wright as well. Love my some bomb soundtracks."
