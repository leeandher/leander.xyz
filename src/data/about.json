  "helloText": "This page is supposed to be more **_personal_** and **_intimate_** than the other ones, and where I get _nice and close_ to you to tell you what kind of _**b o a r d g a m e s**_, I like to play, and other saucy details.\n\nThe TL;DR is that I'm just a normal UW Engineering student but with more of a focus on doing my own thing than doing what my program tells me too. I code websites/apps for fun, play lots of board games, spend way too much money on food, and often just sit around listening to podcasts.\n\nI would describe myself as a _**tech enthusiast**_ if it didn't mean I sound like a douche. I keep up with the latest releases in that world too, from hardware (laptops, phones, parts) to software (operating system updates, new features, etc.). My current setup is pretty sick if I do say so myself: _Razer Blade 15 2018 - GTX 1070 MQ, 512 SSD, i7-8750H._\n\nI also watch a lot of TV/Movies, generally whatever is coming out or popular on Netflix. My tastes are kinda wack, but my favourite genres are **thriller**, **horror**, and **action**. I'm totally open to suggestions so hit me up if you got anything you think I'd like.\n\n_Anyway, I've spent way too long writing about me, I've taken away from the rest of the page about me!_",

Styled Components, and _my beautiful design aesthetic_ are responsible for the UI, no library was good enough for me!"

      "question": "What's your coding setup?",
      "answer": "In terms of hardware, I tend to use Windows laptops, mainly because nothing has provoked me to boot in Linux just yet, and Macs are üí≤üí∏üí∞. I personally believe it's torture to write code without **at least two monitors**, but that may be a hot take. As for my editor, I'm not nearly cool enough to have any Vim scripts so I tend to stick to **VS Code**. I have way too many extensions and custom settings to list off so I'm just going to direct you to my [.config repository](https://github.com/leeandher/.config)."

      "question": "What's the most rewarding personal project you've worked on?",
      "answer": "I think it's a tossup between **Twitter CL** and **Conway**. Even though the former is still a work-in-progress, I think they're both visually impressive when turned on. Twitter CL's ability to stream tweets containing `lit` directly to your terminal feels exciting, while Conway's mock evolution and _dark mode_ are nice to zone out and watch."

    {
      "question": "What's the most challenging personal project you've worked on?",
      "answer": "That one has definitely got to be **lgr.fyi**, my personal URL shortener. The logic behind the shortening and redirecting wasn't all that challenging, but navigating the minefield that is AWS Instances and Load Balances to deploy both the frontend and backend was painful. Eventually I got it all up and running, only to now decide I need to completely redo my hosting situation since AWS is expensive for 24/7 instances past the free tier."

    {
      "question": "You really seem to like coding, why stay in Nanotechnology Engineering?",
      "answer": "I think that it's really interesting! It's definitely a somewhat masochistic degree, and it's not a discipline I see myself starting a career in, but I still think that the content can be pretty cool. I re-discovered programming late January 2018, and so in hindsight, I might've taken a CS or ECE degree, but I like exploring the development world aimlessly, and I couldn't do that with a syllabus breathing down my neck."
