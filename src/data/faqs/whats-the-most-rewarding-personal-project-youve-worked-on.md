question: What's the most rewarding personal project you've worked on?

I think it's a tossup between **Twitter CL** and **Conway**. Even though the former is still a work-in-progress, I think they're both visually impressive when turned on. Twitter CL's ability to stream tweets containing `lit` directly to your terminal feels exciting, while Conway's mock evolution and _dark mode_ are nice to zone out and watch.
