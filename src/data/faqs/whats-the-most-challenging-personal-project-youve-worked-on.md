question: What's the most challenging personal project you've worked on?
---

That one has definitely got to be **lgr.fyi**, my personal URL shortener. The logic behind the shortening and redirecting wasn't all that challenging, but navigating the minefield that is AWS Instances and Load Balances to deploy both the frontend and backend was painful. Eventually I got it all up and running, only to now decide I need to completely redo my hosting situation since AWS is expensive for 24/7 instances past the free tier.
