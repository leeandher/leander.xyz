question: 'You really seem to like coding, why stay in Nanotechnology Engineering?'

I think that it's really interesting! It's definitely a somewhat masochistic degree, and it's not a discipline I see myself starting a career in, but I still think that the content can be pretty cool. I re-discovered programming late January 2018, and so in hindsight, I might've taken a CS or ECE degree, but I like exploring the development world aimlessly, and I couldn't do that with a syllabus breathing down my neck.
