question: What's your coding setup?
---

In terms of hardware, I tend to use Windows laptops, mainly because nothing has provoked be to boot in Linux just yet, and Macs are \$\$\$. I personally believe it's torture to write code with out **at least two monitors**, but that may be a hot take. As for my editor, I'm not nearly cool enough to have any Vim scripts so I tend to stick to **VS Code**. I have way too many extensions and custom settings to list off so I'm just going to direct you to my [.config repository](https://github.com/leeandher/.config).
