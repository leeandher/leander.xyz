    "question": "You really seem to like coding, why stay in Nanotechnology Engineering?",
    "answer": "I think that it's really interesting! It's definitely a somewhat masochistic degree, and it's not a discipline I see myself starting a career in, but I still think that the content can be pretty cool. I re-discovered programming late January 2018, and so in hindsight, I might've taken a CS or ECE degree, but I like exploring the development world aimlessly, and I couldn't do that with a syllabus breathing down my neck."

    "question": "What's the most **rewarding** personal project you've worked on?",
    "answer": "I think it's a tossup between **Twitter CL** and **Conway**. Even though the former is still a work-in-progress, I think they're both visually impressive when turned on. Twitter CL's ability to stream tweets containing `lit` directly to your terminal feels exciting, while Conway's mock evolution and _dark mode_ are nice to zone out and watch."

    "question": "What's the most **challenging** personal project you've worked on?",
    "answer": "That one has definitely got to be **lgr.fyi**, my personal URL shortener.  The logic behind the shortening and redirecting wasn't all that challenging, but navigating the minefield that is AWS Instances and Load Balances to deploy both the frontend and backend was painful. Eventually I got it all up and running, only to now decide I need to completely redo my hosting situation since AWS is expensive for 24/7 instances past the free tier."

  {
    "question": "What's your coding setup?",
    "answer": "I, like most JS developers, love VSCode  My personal machine is a Windows laptop (Razer Blade 15) but I've used MacOS at work for React Native work "
