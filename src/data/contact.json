Just fill out this little form here and you I'll try my best to get back to you as soon as possible!\n\nIf you just want to know a little bit more about me, check out the [/about](https://www.leander.xyz/about) page, where I list off a few of my ðŸ”¥ picks and answer a few FAQs (which I wrote myself, so they're like fake FAQs but it's cool).\n\nOn the off chance you're impressed by all this and want to know more about me career-wise, check out the [/resume](https://www.leander.xyz/resume) page. I think it's pretty neat, and you can pretty much get the TL;DR of my life, along with a PDF version for you to file away under _'if we get desperate'_.\n\nIf you'd actually like to submit a bug report for the site, there is a link in the footer that would keep things a little more organized, but honestly, there are no set rules.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!",
