  "self-description": "Hey there, my name is in that big colourful box up there and welcome to my site! You've found my little <mark>my corner of the internet</mark>! I'm a 20 year old, programming dork based out of Toronto, and currently going to school at the University of Waterloo. I like to build cool stuff, learn how to build cool stuff, and work at jobs where I get to build cool stuff. \n\nHere's me at a glance:\n\n```\nJSON.stringify(Leander)\n```\n\n```js\n{\n  name: \"Leander Rodrigues\",\n  age: 20,\n  school: \"University of Waterloo\",\n  program: {    faculty: \"Engineering\"  }\n  location: \"Toronto, ON, Canada\",\n  gradYear: 2021,\n  availableForHire: true\n}\n```\n\nI don't exactly have a _normal_ background in programming, but that's the <s>problem</s> best part about being self-taught, you gotta learn new things **c o n s t a n t l y**.\nAt the moment, I'm super into web development, but I've worked on game development (Unity) and mobile development (iOS/Android) at some previous co-op jobs! \n\nAs for this fancy, schmancy site, I [write some things](https://www.leander.xyz/blog), [take some notes](https://www.leander.xyz/notes), and sometimes [build stuff](https://www.leander.xyz/projects). If you like what you see, and decide I've passed the first gauntlet, check out [my digi-resume](https://www.leander.xyz/resume) or [shoot me a message](https://www.leander.xyz/contact) and I'll get back to you ASAP!"
