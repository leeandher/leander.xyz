  "self-description": "<mark>ðŸš¨ Still in development! ðŸš¨</mark>\n\nHey there, Welcome to my site! You've found what I like to call **my corner of the internet**! \nWho am I? Really just some 20 year old, programming nerd based out of Toronto. I like to build cool stuff, watch tutorials on building cool stuff, and work jobs where I get to build cool stuff. At the moment, I tend to focus on web development, but I've worked on game development (Unity) and mobile development (iOS/Android).'\n\nIf you're a robot (or understand JSON) this might be easier to parse than reading paragraphs:\n\n```js\nlet leander = {\n  name: \"Leander Rodrigues\",\n  age: 20,\n  school: \"University of Waterloo\",\n  program: \"Nanotechnology Engineering\",\n  location: \"Toronto, ON, Canada\",\n  gradYear: 2021,\n  availableForHire: true,\n}\n```\n\nI [write some things](https://www.leander.xyz/blog), [take some notes](https://www.leander.xyz/notes), and sometimes [build stuff](https://www.leander.xyz/projects). If you'd like to know more about me you can check out [my digi-resume](https://www.leander.xyz/resume)"
