  "self-description": "<mark>ðŸš¨ Still in development! ðŸš¨</mark>\n\nHey there, Welcome to my site! You've found what I like to call **my corner of the internet**! \nWho am I? Really just some 20 year old, programming nerd based out of Toronto. I like to build cool stuff, watch tutorials on building cool stuff, and work jobs where I get to build cool stuff. At the moment, I tend to focus on web development, but I've worked on game development (Unity) and mobile development (iOS/Android).\n\nI [write some things](https://www.leander.xyz/blog), [take some notes](https://www.leander.xyz/notes), and sometimes [build stuff](https://www.leander.xyz/projects). If you'd like to know more about me you can check out my [about page](https://www.leander.xyz/about) or (my digi-resume)[https://www.leander.xyz/resume].\n\n"
