## August 2018 - I miss my green squares

### September 8, 2018

Long story short, I miss my green squares. I talked a lot about August in my July update (mainly because I wrote it so late in the month), but I wanted to touch on a few other things before I forget. First of all, the green squares thing. Most of the school year I was just dabbling in Software Engineering homework, trying to do one or two of the JS30 challenges every week. I've definitely talked about it before. See the problem arises, that when I actually started the repo, I didn't really understand or know that much about git, or github. So I pretty much mimicked Wes Bos' repository without actually forking it. To me, that seemed kinda disingenuous.

So without really thinking about it, I just forked the _actual_ JS30 repo, and _deleted_ my own. Even though GitHub asked like a billion times whether or not I wanted to delete it (and if I was sure), I didn't really think about the contributions on my profile graph. And with that, I lost so, so, so many green squares. It makes the past three months look barren.

I mean, to be fair, I didn't really do that much since I was full-time with school anyway, but now it looks even worse. The only way to redeem myself now is to just earn back that rep by doing more coding work and building up some more squares going forward (without just committing pointless changes). I know it's probably way superficial, but I care heavily about aesthetics (just you wait, I'm gonna touch on that in my next post).

Besides that, I pretty much spent August catching up with friends and enjoying the break from school. I played a lot of video games, watched a lot of netflix, and spent a lot of money; so a standard summer break. Now, while my high school friends get ready to head back to their respective universities, I'm had to get ready for my next co-op! Accenture woot woot! I know it's a bit of a spoiler-ish type thing since this post is supposed to be about August, but I make the rules so I'm gonna talk about it.

I started with Accenture last Wednesday (the 5th)! I've pretty much only been doing orientation but I already love this job. It seems like the people are really cool, the job is really interesting (and hard) and I'm going to learn a lot for sure. Obviously due to the nature of the
