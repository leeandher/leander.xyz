I'm just writting this little blurb because I'm super excited to say that my email, me@leander.xyz is now live! It wasn't all that hard, all it took was some work in cPanel and manual setup but now I'll get the emails directly to my phone and it works great! I'm super excited about this, it feels like a major step forward. Besides just creating template pages, the major challenges I'm facing now are creating the Notes/Blog databases and an administrative login so that I can actually publish the blog posts and everything. Besides that I'm almost done this whole site setup deal! I can't wait for the site to be public. Right now I have everything set up in a CodePen Pro Project so that I can show and control edits on the fly. I'm really proud with how the entire revamp is going. Not only is it a great challenge but I think It's a good creative challenge to keep myself busy. I also redid my logo for this site, so that's pretty exciting as well! THat being said, if you're reading this, you can see the logo right now and can't see the old one, but trust me it was not that great.
