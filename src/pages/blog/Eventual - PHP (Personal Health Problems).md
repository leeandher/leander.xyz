## PHP (Personal Health Problems)

### September 15, 2018

Man, being healthy is rough. Pretty much all of August was a write off for me health-wise. The first half was mid-exam season which, I'd guess, is the worst few weeks for any college student health-wise. That and homecoming probably. Regardless, I was eating out pretty much everyday (since I kept telling myself I didn't have time to cook) and as a result saw my account balance drop off a cliff. That was unfortunate, but I was optimistic in thinking I could give my account some time to heal, since I'll be living at home at least until December, and to be honest, I still think so.

But then the second half of August happened.

Turns out that hanging out with old friends (high school and whatnot) is just gathering groups of people to spend money with AND getting food you shouldn't be eating. Wings, cookies, bubble tea, ice cream, anything at the CNE, all that kinda stuff. Do I regret it? Nah, not really, I mean the money is whatever since it comes with catching up with friends, but I do wish I gave more attention to my health before ordering a large blizzard every time I pass a DQ.

So to do that, I gotta pledge or something. I want to start doing two things. I want to eat healthier, and start going to the gym. I think Accenture has some sort of healthy-lifestyle compensation thing so we'll see if I can arrange that, but regardless I gotta get out and do something. Honestly the only reason I didn't gain 900 pounds in the past few weeks is my 12500 steps a day from trying to catch Pokemon (plus some biking I guess). I keep trying to put this off but I really really gotta start soon, I can't keep at it like this. I feel like a billion people before me have written pretty much the same thing down, like a call to arms for their will power, but let's hope I can actually pull through.
