Man oh man, this is super exciting. This post should have probably been written months ago, but I run this town so whatever. A few months back, Jordine gave me an absolutely killer birthday gift, and I just want to waffle on about it for a lil' bit. It is a "100 Movies Hitlist" poster, with little squares depicting a bunch of modern awesome films. The cool part is the little squares are hidden behind scratch-offs, intended to be revealed after you've seen the movie! AHHH it's so cool. This isn't the bullshit _most impactful_ movies where half of them are boring Italian dramas.

**🔥🔥 This is the real deal, _baller_ movie list 🔥🔥**

Let me rattle off a few of them:

* Fight Club
* Dark Knight
* Mean Girls
* Reservoir Dogs
* Halloween
* Spirited Away
* American Psycho
* Citizen Kane

These are like relatively new_\-ish_ and not just boring old historical films, and I think that's the best part. I actually find that when I throw on these movies I'm super interested, and even invested since the poster advocates for them. I'm only about 20% of the way through the entire poster, but there are a few movies I've never watched before that become favourites almost instantly. Let me throw out some of those:

* The Intouchables
* Leon: The Professional (_Holy shit, Natalie Portman was so little_)
* Office Space (**oh my god, this movie holds up**)

This is literally the perfect gift for a guy like me. I'm a total achievement hunter. I get obsessed with seeing the _100%_ beside the games I play, and always have. These are the stats from my PS4 account, PS3 account, and Steam account.

Knowing that, it makes total sense that I decided to take this like an achievement list that I need to accomplish. I put all the movies into a digital to-do list and started checking them off whenever I had time: on trains, buses, before bed, while I should be doing something important, etc. That being said, I am playing it on hardmode.

**I decided that I wouldn't scratch off movies I'd seen prior to getting the poster.**

And honestly who can @me. These movies are awesome, and getting an excuse to rewatch films like _Alien_, or_Memento_, is just an opportunity I won't pass up on. This is even a cool **date night** event, since **Jordine has never seen a movie in her life** (_or might as well have not, I mean who hasn't seen the Dark Knight, wtf_). Now she can build up a movie knowledge background and go out into the world unafraid of pop culture, thanks to this poster.

This isn't an ad (_but oh heck do I wish it was, this website just costs me money_), but if hearing me chat has made you want the poster, it's [available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Gift-Republic-GR630004-Bucket-Poster/dp/B075SDQ2K8/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=100+movie+poster&qid=1559832115&s=gateway&sr=8-3) with some cool variations too. Solid gift choice 👌👌

Anyway, I think I'm going to be putting up a few more posts with progress update: maybe at like _50%_, _75%_ and _100%._ Just thinking about getting to those number is hype, but damn that's a long time. I should probably set a schedule to watch like 2 a week or something, but we both know I'm too lazy for that.
