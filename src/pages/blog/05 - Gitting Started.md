So I've taken it on as a weekend concept to get started with Git. This entire time I've pretty much been treating GitHub as the coder-friendly version of Dropbox, simply uploading new files entirely and never using the command line. The furthest I'd gotten was installing GitHub for Desktop, then drag and dropping files in there to communicate with my repo, but even that was lacking. So this weekend I've forced myself to persist with only using command-line to track changes and commits in my repos, while doing a massive backend restructuring of my current site. It's been a slow start, and I still only know the basic git commands (add, status, diff, merge, commit) but I now see just how powerful a tool it is!

It's so satisfying to switch from your open project after you've completed a decent chunk, or an important section and then push those to GitHub in command line (it makes you feel like a hacker). I guarantee this feeling will fade but for now it's still got its spark. This is one of those times where I can feel myself growing as a developer but still see the absolute mountain of concepts and commands I still have to learn. All in all, it's been a good start to the weekend.
