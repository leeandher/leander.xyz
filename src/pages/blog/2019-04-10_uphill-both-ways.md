<p>Now that April is over, I wanted to do another update on my progress. For the past week I've been working largely on my first Work Term Report (WTR). It's this mandatory report that the University of Waterloo requires upon completion of the work term, and it has a bunch of specifications for formatting, content, and grammar. I've been writing, rewriting, editing, and crying trying to get this thing out of the way so I can work on my site. The WTR is due this Friday (May 04), and co-op positions are open for application in about two weeks (May 14), so I <b><i>need</i></b> my site up by then.</p>

<p>Since I've been on co-op in a Data Analysis position, I chose their System Architecture to write about for my WTR. I'm finding a lot of little hiccups that keep coming up, but for the most part it's been a lot easier to write about something that you're the expert on. I've been working with their Automation system for the whole four months, so I understand it really well, however, the difficulty is in communicating that in the WTR. I find myself going on these long boring rants about specific languages and reports and blah blah blah, none of that is necessary. While I truly despise having to work on this over what <i>I</i> want to do, I can't completely discredit it. I've gotten better at deciding what needs to be cut when writing explanatory sections, which would do wonders for my documentation skills.</p>

<p>As for my website deployment, I made a great breakthrough last week. I was able to configure <code>$_GET</code> requests to link to articles from my blog database and display them to the user super quick. They display in the blog format and has HTML markup so that I can bold, link, highlight, and even use my template CSS classes if I wanted to. Another great part, since the actual blog posts are stored in rows in my database table, I was able to add tags and pop-out quotes as well. Long story short, If you're reading this, I did what I was trying to do.</p>

<p>April has been a pretty busy month, but I have a feeling it's just going to get worse. Not that that's bad (I like keeping myself busy), but I really enjoyed the amount of time I could dedicate to side projects. I'm going to do my best to keep with the lessons and online courses/challenges, but I really do want to get at least one or two projects done while I'm back at University. I still have that React Bootcamp to finish, as well as the PHP Login System I want to test out.</p>

<p>So much to do, so little time. But that's life, I guess.</p>
