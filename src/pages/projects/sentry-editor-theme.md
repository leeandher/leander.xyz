During my first week full time at Sentry, I partipated in a Hackathon we dub Hackweek. I literally started on the Monday, so most of the codebase was new and scary, but I still wanted to participate. I spent most of the week completing my onboarding materials and getting settled into the job, but I made sure to ship a (small) project by the end of the week that I'm pretty proud of!

I actually really love how this theme turned out and really ties together the work environment I've got going at Sentry.io. The designers over there really know their colour theory ðŸ’ª
