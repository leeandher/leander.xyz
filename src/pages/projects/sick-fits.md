# Sick Fits



## Using the app

## How it Works

## Creds

I was able to create this application through the help of a course, developed by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com) entitled [Advanced React and GraphQL](https://advancedreact.com). If you've stumbled upon this project, in attempt to learn react, I highly recommend his courses and wish you the best of luck!
