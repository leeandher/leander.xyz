  This one is a dumb project that took a few hours from create-react-app to
  deployment. Super super dumb, I'd skip looking at this one.

I think this one is pretty self-explanatory. It's just a Single Page App to simulate making grilled cheese sandwiches. 

It's kinda my first time playing around with hooks, and I finally ended up using CSS depending on Dark/Light Theme Preferences, but besides that it's just a dumb little app.
