# Learn Redux (November 2018)

This is a collection of notes I compiled from the [Learn Redux Course](https://learnredux.com) offered by [Wes Bos](wesbos.com/courses)!

Feel free to look through and learn, and if anything confusing (or blatantly wrong, since I was learning at the time too), please just send me a message or make a PR.

Thanks!
