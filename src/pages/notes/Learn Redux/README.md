# Learn Redux

<date>November 2018</date>

This is a collection of notes I compiled from the [Learn Redux Course](https://learnredux.com) offered by [Wes Bos](wesbos.com/courses)!

This was my first time working with Redux so the details might not be completely ironed out, but it's a good introduction to the key points one should know before starting a new project.
