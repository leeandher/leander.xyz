# Learn Redux

<time>November 2018</time>

This is a collection of notes I compiled from the [Learn Redux Course](https://learnredux.com) offered by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/courses)!

These notes don't detail how to implement Redux in JavaScript, but instead provide some useful background info into how Redux' State Manment concepts. You should definitely take a look at this collection if words like _actions_, _dispatch_, and _reducer_ strike fear into your heart.

Best of luck!
