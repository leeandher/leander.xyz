# React 101

<time>February 2018</time>

This is a collection of notes I compiled from the [React 101, Course, Parts I and II](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101) offered by [Codecademy](codecademy.com) and the [React for Beginners Course](https://reactforbeginners.com) offered by [Wes Bos](wesbos.com/courses)!

If you've heard the word **React** thrown around a few times, and you wanna learn some more, this is the note collection for you. In here you'll find a beginner's guide to writing applications in React, covering all the basics that you can take with you into your next project.

While these notes were written during the time of React 15, they're still helpful to understand concepts, and to grasp what goes on under the hood.
