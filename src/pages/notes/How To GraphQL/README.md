# How to GraphQL

<time>January 2019</time>

Welcome to some course notes I took during the [HowToGraphQL](https://howtographql.com) introductory module! I'd never touched GraphQL before this, and if you're in the same boat, you'll find some helpful definitions and concepts here.

**If you're looking for code examples and actual use-cases, I suggest the Advanced React course notes**. There I actually noted important steps while building the server, resolvers and front-end. This is just an _first-look-at_ style overview of GraphQL
