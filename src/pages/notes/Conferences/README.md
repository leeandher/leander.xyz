# Conferences

<time>January 15, 2018</time>

I've always found that other people know a lot of things. Here is a collection of me trying to steal those things they know while they speak them to an audience.

This note collection contains jot notes I've taken during talks or conferences. I don't go to as many of these as I like, but If I've learned anything at any of them, I sure hope it's in this section because my memory is awful.

There isn't really a specific topic for these notes, they're kinda scatter-brained and dependent on the speaker, but they're probably pretty insightful/important/neat if they compelled me to write down what they were saying!
