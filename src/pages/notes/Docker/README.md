# Docker (February 2019)

This is a collection of notes I compiled from a bunch of different resources while I was trying to learn about _Docker_. They are all listed below!

- [How does Docker work? - Fullstack Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6LtRb1OJuw)
- [Docker Engine Docs - Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container/)
- [Docker Compose Docs - Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/)
- [How to use Docker Compose - Linode](https://www.linode.com/docs/applications/containers/how-to-use-docker-compose/)

Feel free to look through and learn, and if anything confusing (or blatently wrong, since I was learning at the time too), please just send me a message or make a PR.

Thanks!
