# Learn Node

<time>November 2018</time>

This is a collection of notes I compiled from the [Learn Node Course](https://learnnode.com) offered by [Wes Bos](wesbos.com/courses)!

As my first time touching back-end JavaScript these notes document everything from User Authentication, to server management with **Express.js** to database interfacing with **MongoDB**.
It even dives into best practices when setting up a Node.js Server, including things like _MVC Design Patterns_.

If you've never worked with Node before, this is a great place to take a look around.
