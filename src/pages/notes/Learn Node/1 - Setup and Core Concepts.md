## MongoDB and ENV

In order to set up a MongoDB database (or any sort of database for that matter), it's best practice to create a `.env` file, which contains the app's sensitive information

```env
DATABASE=mongodb://user:pass@host.com:port/database
PORT=7777
MAP_KEY=456123
SECRET=twizzlers
```

The `dotenv` node package is used to reference the `.env` file. It stores the data for access as a `process.env` object (created by calling `require('dotenv').config({path: filename.env})`).

The template for the database connection is used in mongoDB specifically in order to connect. For example, a `localhost` example (without a username/password), connecting to the `admin` database on port `27017` would be:

```
DATABASE=mongodb://localhost:27017/admin
```

Another important note, if you are setting up MongoDB on your local machine (instead of using a DB as a Service), and it happens to be running Windows, you will have to create a `C:\data\db` directory in order setup. To actually make it run, navigate to `C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\versionNumber\bin` and run `mongod` in a terminal. Congrats, you've spun up your database. ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

## Routing

Routing is the way of sending our app/user different sets of data based on the URL path. For this project, `express.Router()` is used for this.

The router let's us specify the file path, and the type of request, followed by what to do with it. See the following:

```js
const router = express.Router()
// Perform this function for GET requests on homepage
router.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  // req -> request object
  // res -> response object
  // next -> operation for middleware (more on this later)
  // req.query -> references localhost:PORT/?key1=value1&key2=value2
  // res.send() -> sends page data, ex: <p>Hello World!</p>
  // res.json() -> send JSON object (for API calls)
  const me = {
    name: "leander",
    age: 19,
    other: req.query.other,
  }
  res.json(me)
})
// Use the controller's addPage function to control the POST requests on localhost:PORT/add
router.post("/add", storeController.addStore)
```

## Templating, Helpers and Mixins

**Templates** are a useful way to write reusable markup. For this app, the templating language used is `pug` (or formerly known as `jade`). which was chosen for its seamless integration with js.

The syntax of the templating language depends on which is chosen, but regardless, the core concept is the same; create a page which can accept data to dynamically create a new page.

```js
// Use pug as the template engine
app.set("view engine", "pug");

// This is a controller, which is helpful for MVC programming. More on this later...
exports.addStore = (req, res) => {
  // The response renders a template 'editStore.pug', and passes the template data
  res.render("editStore", { title: "Hello World!" });
};

/*  ---- Within editStore.pug ----  */

extends layout // Use the layout.pug template

block content // Change the 'content' block of layout.pug to the following markup
  // Reference the supplied parameters
  h2 #{title}
  h3= title
```

**Helpers** are another useful way to write templates. They allow you to perform some basic functionality/operations on the incoming data for each template. Simple things like loops over arrays, key-value destructuring, comparators, and conditionals are all available for most templating languages.

In order to create your own helpers, simple put them in a `helpers.js` file as:

```js
exports.example = "example value"
exports.dump = obj => JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2)
```

or something of the sort. Then, using middleware, they can be used in Express:

```js
// Import the file
const helpers = require("./helpers.js");

// Add it as a helper
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.locals.h = helpers;
  next();
});

// Use it throughout the app (ex. pug)
h1 This is how a helper is used: #{h.example}
```

**Mixins** are a way of extending the modularity even further, essentially creating reusable components for multiple templates. For example, if your `updateStore.pug` template, and `addStore.pug` template both present the same form, with the same parameters, a `_storeForm.pug` mixin is probably a good idea.

_Note: To distinguish mixins, it is recommended to store them in a separate directory, with filenames starting with an underscore._

In pug, mixins can be referenced and used as follows:

```pug
extends layout

include mixins/_storeForm

block content
  h1 Preceding data
  +storeForm({store: 'Cool Cats'})

<!-- Within _storeForm.pug -->
//- Declared similar to JS functions
mixin storeForm(store = '')
  //- Your template with its param values
  h1= store
```

**Take advantage of templating, it's a useful tool!**

## MVC and Controllers

MVC programming is a code architecture concept. It stands for **Model**, **View**, **Controller**. It outlines a way of developing applications to process logic and display content to end users by separating the code into three distinct areas.

The **model** refers to the code layer which performs operations on the backend. This can be the seen as the requests for fetching/querying the database. In an analogy, the model is the _pizza place_.

The **view** is what the user sees. We think of the view as the templates and display. For the purpose of this application, these are the `.pug` files. We must display all of our information back to the user through the view. In an analogy, the view is _your apartment_.

The **controller** is the bridge between the **model** and the **view**. It gets data from the model, then passes it on to the view. In an analogy, the controller is the _delivery driver_.

//Analogy

By keeping the controllers separate from the model and view, we allow for a modular application, with reusable bits of code. We can create a controller by creating a separate file and exporting its functionality:

```js
/*  ---- Model ----  */
const storeController = require("./storeController")

router.get("/", storeController.homepage)
router.get("/add", storeController.addStore)

/*  ---- View ----  */
index.pug
editStore.pug

/*  ---- Controller ----  */
exports.homePage = (req, res) => {
  res.render("index")
}

exports.addStore = (req, res) => {
  res.render("editStore", { ...params })
}
```

## Middleware and Error Handling

**Middleware** is a term used to refer to the processing or functionality that goes on _after_ the request, but _before_ the response. Middleware is the main way of performing bulk operations through express, and it's passed simply as just another parameter to a normal controller function. Take the following code as an example.

```js
// Within the exampleController.js file
exports.myMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  req.myMiddleWareVariable = "Example"
  console.log("This is an")
  next()
}

exports.myResponse = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.myMiddleWareVariable)
  res.send("Finished")
}

// Then we would call upon the middleware as shown:
// router.get(route, controller)
router.get(
  "/example",
  exampleController.myMiddleWare,
  exampleController.myResponse,
)

// When navigating to the route /example
//  -> console: This is an
//  -> console: Example
//  -> page: Finished
```

That is an example of route-specific middleware, but Express also has the capability for global middleware. This allows every single request to pass through the same middleware, enabling application-wide functionality.

This is called through the function `app.use()`.

```js
// app.use(middlewareFunction)
app.use(setTheseVariables)
app.use(gatherTheseStaticAssets)
app.use(makeThisDBFolder)
```

We can use middleware for **error handling** as well. If we queue up a bunch of functions to run before a certain operation, we can handle the edge cases on returns. For example:

```js
// All routes starting at /admin use the adminRoutes router
const adminRoutes = require("./adminRoutes")
// app.use("/", routes);
app.use("/admin", adminRoutes)
app.use(errorHandlers.notFound)
```

Since that line is commented, if we navigate to anything other than `localhost:PORT/admin`, we will run into the fallback error handler: `errorHandlers.notFound`.
