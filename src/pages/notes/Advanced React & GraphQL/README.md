# Advanced React and GraphQL

<time>June - August 2019</time>

This is a collection of notes I compiled from the [Advanced React Course](https://advancedreact.com) offered by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/courses)!

These notes cover every part of building modern full-stack web applications with React and GraphQL! How to build a GraphQL serer with _Prisma_, data models, schemas and resolvers, along with setting up _Next_ with Server-side Rendering, Routing, and so on, for a beautiful fast front-end. It even covers using _Apollo_ (for data management and caching), and implementing Stripe for building your own eCommerce platform!
